# IssueLifeCycleManagement
Currently They are releasing Vue Storefront versions once a month. While this is great in terms of delivering quick fixes and shipping new features to everyone without waiting ages for a new version of software  
it has some downsides.  
As number of contributions grow it becomes harder and harder to test everything and be sure that the application remains stable and performant in such a short release lifecycle.   Moreover one-month release cycle with new features introduced in every of them is not very good for a sustainable and future-proof architecture since   everything that is added can be user right after the release which implies that any potential DX issues can't be easly fixed without breaking changes. It also leaves   
almost no space to adjust PRs to feedback after merging them.
They were thinking about the solution for quite some time. While we still want to keep as short release cycle as possible to give new features and improvements to the community as fast as possible we also want to work more on stability and DX of every new feature.
  Now their new LifeCycle will be:
  In the A phase of the release lifecycle we will focus on delivering new features and widening current APIs. After A release community users will be able to grab a beta-ish set of features and start adopting them into their stores, testing and giving feedback.

  In the B phase of the release lifecycle we will focus on stability and developer experience. It means:
in-depth testing of features introduced in release A
bugfixing and performance stability work
API corrections for features from phase A based on feedback if the DX wasn;'t as good as expected
writing unit/integration tests for introduced features.  
According to the process of VueStoreFront,  

  When any bug came,they make the bug report acording to template given already in the github project,and added to the issues.
Comments are done on the bug report.
Any person who become willing to handle the issue gives his aggreement and then he solve the issue.When issue become resolved ,issue is closed.
