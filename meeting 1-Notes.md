# Notes of First Meeting
We started finding open source projects to work for understanding the non functional requirements. After our long survey, we found three projects.

## First:  Android app named as Natrium app
Link of github code of that project is https://github.com/appditto/natrium_wallet_flutter.

## Second: Open Source web software named as Dolibarr
Link of github code of that project is https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr.

## Third:  Open source web site named as vue StoreFront
Link of github code of that project is https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront.

So we will work on these projects for this assignment.
