# Installation  
Before proceeding, make sure you have Node 14 (opens new window)installed.  
You can check this by running the following command:

node -v  

## Step 1: Generate a new project  
The easiest way to get started with Vue Storefront is to set up your project using our CLI. We can run it using the following command:

npx @vue-storefront/cli generate store
It will ask you to enter the project's name and select the e-commerce platform you wish to use. Once selected, the CLI will create project files in the directory matching your project name.

CLI will use the project name you enter to create a new directory, so avoid using special characters and spaces.

 ## Step 2: Install dependencies  
Go to the newly created directory and install the required dependencies:  

cd <project_name>  

npm install  
## Step 3: Configure the project   
 The next step is to configure your project, and it's different for every e-commerce integration. Go to the Integrations page, open the documentation for the integration you selected in our CLI, and look for the page describing the configuration steps.  

## Step 4: Start the project  
The project is now ready. You can start the application in development mode using the command below. We can read more about available commands and environments on the Commands and deployment (opens new window)page in Nuxt.js documentation.  

npm run dev  

## Recommended tools  
Below are the tools we use to make the development and debugging easier, and we recommend you use them too.  

Vue.js Devtools  
They strongly recommend installing Vue.js Devtools (opens new window)in your browser. It's an excellent tool for viewing component structures and their current state, inspecting events, routes, and much more.

# Extension Documentation
First, you should consider which part of the application you need to extend - frontend, backend, or both. Depending on your needs, you may need to extend:

Vue.js  
Nuxt.js  
Server Middleware  

## Extending Vue.js  
Plugins allow adding global-level functionalities to Vue.js, such as components, methods, helpers, or directives. These mainly extend the frontend portion of the application and can be divided into two categories:

UI plugins;  
Non-UI plugins;  

### Vue.js UI plugins  
UI plugins extend how the application looks or behaves on user interactions. They include plugins that add support for:  

1)event handling;  
2)responsive design, resizing, scrolling, and animations;  
3)handling forms and validation;  
4)routing, lazy loading, lazy hydration, meta tags;  


### Vue.js non-UI plugins  
Non-UI plugins extend how the application works under the hood or handles state and storage. They include plugins that add support for:

making HTTP requests;  
internationalization (i18n);  
custom events;  
persistence (storage);  
state management;  


## Extending Nuxt.js  
Nuxt.js offers two ways of extending its functionalities:  

plugins;  
modules and build modules;  
Nuxt.js plugins  
Nuxt.js imports plugins in browser (client-only), server (server-only), or both before creating the root Vue.js application. For this reason, you can use them to register Vue.js plugins.  

See the Plugins directory (opens new window)page in Nuxt.js documentation to learn more.

Nuxt.js modules and build modules   
Nuxt.js modules can customize almost any aspect of your project. They are functions called sequentially on the server when the Nuxt.js application is booting.  

You can use them to:  

register Nuxt.js plugins;  
add support for various UI frameworks;  
enable PWA or AMP;  
optimize images and other static assets;  
create a sitemap, generate robots.txt file or meta tags for social media platforms;  
registering various HTTP clients, such as axios or Apollo;  
add Google Tag Manager, Google GTag;  
integrate with CMSs, payment providers, error monitoring software;  


## Extending Server Middleware 
As you might have read on a page dedicated to the Server Middleware, it's an Express proxy that handles traffic between your application and external services, such as eCommerce or CMS platforms. Server Middleware configuration allows to:

register integrations;  
extend existing integrations using extensions;  


### Server Middleware extensions  
Server Middleware extensions add or modify functionalities of already existing Server Middleware integrations. They may extend the Express.js server, register additional API endpoints, or inject into the lifecycle of a request.
